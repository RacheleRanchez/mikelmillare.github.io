		<h1>Mikel's Bio</h1><br>
		<p> Mikel Millare is unapologetic and unafraid of being his most authentic self. Growing up in the Middle-of-Nowhere, La Union , Mikel escaped

		wanted to escape but his fantasy she wanted to live. 

        Mikel now wants to help everyone else live their fantasy! </p>
